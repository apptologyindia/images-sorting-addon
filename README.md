# About the Add-on

This addon will add sorting by Images to the products. If product does not have an Image, it will be moved to the end of product list. Or it will be hidden from product list, if you will select corresponding box. If vendor/admin add an Image to the product, product will be shown as usual.

In the Administration panel, this addon can only move products to the end, if the Use in Administration panel box was selected.
